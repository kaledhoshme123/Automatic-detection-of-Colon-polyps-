# Automatic-detection-of-Colon-polyps-
Polyps are lesions within the bowel detectable as mucosal outgrows. The polyps are either flat, elevated or pedunculated, and can be distinguished from normal mucosa by color and surface pattern. Most bowel polyps are harmless, but some have the potential to grow into cancer.
